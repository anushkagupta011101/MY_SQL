# SQL : 
It stands for structured Query Language
It is a database language or programming language.
It is used to access, communicate and manipulate the data in database

________________________________________________________________________

DATA: It is a collection of rows, facts and figures.

INFORMATION: All useful data are my information.

DATABASE: It is a collection of files/tables where we store data/information in tabular form.


 ------------------[ BIT> BYTE> FIELD> RECORD> TABLE> FILES]-----------------


----------------------DBMS------------------------------
It stands for database management system.
It is a software which helps to manage, control, a database, allowing user to create, access and manipulate data.

---------------------RDBMS------------------------------------
It stands for Relational database management system
It is a specific type of DBMS that stores and organize data in tables, with relationships between tables defined by key.


-------------------------DATABASE KEYS-----------------------

1. PRIMARY KEY: A key that do not have null values and do not have duplicates is called a primary key. It ensures that no two records can have same values for the primary key column.

2. FORIEGN KEY:It is a set of column or column in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. It ensures that data in the tables is consistent

3.SUPER KEY: It is a set of one or more column that can be used uniquely identify rows in a table. It may include extra column beyond what's necessary for a minimal unique identifier.

4. UNIQUE KEY: It ensures that each value in a column or set of column in unique. It prevent duplicate value and allow only one null value.

5. CANDIDATE KEY: A minimal super key that uniquely identifies rows. A primary key is a chosen candidate key.

6. COMPOSITE KEY: It is a primary key that consist of two or more columns. Used uniquely identified rows when a single column isn't enough.
NOTE: COMPOUND KEY IS THE ANOTHER NAME OF COMPOSITE KEYS

7. SURROGATE KEYS: It is an artificially generated key, often an integer or GUI, used as a primary key. It is not derived from the actual data in the table and is primarily used for performance and simplicity. It doesn't change even if business data changes.

8. NATURAL KEY: It is a primary key derived from meaningful data with the table. It is based on one or more existing column that have a real world significance.

*********************************** MY SQL********************************************

It is a software where we use SQL language. MY SQL is a RDBMS or DBMS that manages and control a database allowing user to create, access and manipulate data.

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SQL AND MY SQL:
SQL: It is a language. It remains same

MY SQL:  It is a DBMS or RDBMS. It is installed and should be updated time to time.

NOTE: The code or statements of SQL works almost 90% in the other DBMS and only 10% have special codes, that's why SQL is widely used.

:- Data is generated maximum on social plateforms after that E-commerce.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS IN SQL
i) DDL:  DATA DEFINE LANGUAGE
ii) DML: DATA MANIPUALATION LANGUAGE
iii) DCL: DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE
iv) TCL: TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE
v) DQL: DATA QUERY LANGUAGE


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DDL: It is used to built structure of any table

It includes five statmenets:
1. CREATE: used to create any table, view, store procedure and function
2. DROP: It is used to delete the database, table, view, store procedure and function
3. ALTER: It is used to rename a table
          It is used to rename column header from table
          It is used to add a column
          It is used to delete a column
          It is used to modify the datatype from table
4. TRUNCATE: It is used to delete entire data and keep the format only of a table


DML: Data Manipulation Language

It is used to clean the data and for updating values and data into the table
It includes three statements:

1. INSERT: It is used to add data in rows/records. We need to enter data in each row if we left any row empty, It will show error.
2. UPDATE: It is used to add value or replace value in particular cell by condition.
3. DELETE: It is used to delete a particular rows by condition.

NOTE: TO RUN INSERT AND DELETE STATEMENTS WE NEED TURN OF THE SET SQL UPDATE
          SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0   [TURN OFF]
          SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1   [TURN ON]

DCL: Data Control Language

It deals with control and security of data with the database.

i) GRANT: It provide permission to access the data from database.
ii) REVOKE: It restricts the permission from user.


TCL: Transaction Control Language
SAVE POINT: It saves the data in temporary base and set a point where we can roll back.
ROLL BACK: It is used to take a step back in your data (undo).
COMMIT: It permanently save your data and restricts editing access.

DQL: Data Query Language

SELECT: It is used to retrieve database or table and show output.



************************************ FUNCTIONS*************************************************

1. MATHEMATICAL FUNCTION:
i). FLOOR: It show the value before the decimal or round down the number
                floor(25.9)-----25
                floor(14.1)----14

ii) CIEL: It show round up the number or show the next value.
                 ceil(13.1)-----14
                 ceil(15.5)------16

iii) ROUND: It work condition to round the value if number of decimal is greater than or equal to (0.5) then show next value else same value.
                  round(12.5)-----13
                  round(11.4)-----11

iv) ABS(ABSOLUTE): It convert the negative number is positve
                  ABS(-11)------11
